# UI Docs

## Description

This is the explanation for the UI code of the project mainly written in Javascript & React

## Introduction

This document outlines the build process for the user interface of the project, using React.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. A code editor like VS Code is recommended for editing the project files.

## Development Environment Setup

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

- `git clone <repository-url>`
- `cd path/to/project`

Install necessary dependencies:

- `npm install`

## File Explanation: `index.js`

- **Imports**: The file imports React, ReactDOM, main CSS, and the App component.
- **Root Container**: Creates a root container using `ReactDOM.createRoot` and attaches it to the `root` div in the HTML.
- **Rendering**: Renders the `<App />` component within the root container.

## Building the Project

Build the project for production by running:

- `npm run build`

This compiles the application into static files in the `build` directory.

## Performance Measurement

To measure the performance of your app, pass a function to log results or send them to an analytics endpoint. More information available at [React CRA vitals](https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals).
